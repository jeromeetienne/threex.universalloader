How To Install It
=================

You can install it via script tag

```html
<script src='threex.universalloader.js'></script>
```

Or you can install with [bower](http://bower.io/), as you wish.

```bash
bower install threex.universalloader
```

How To Use It
=============

Here is a basic usage. First you create the loader itself

```javascript
var loader  = new THREEx.UniversalLoader()
```

Then you trigger the loading of your model. Say you want to load a 
model at ```models/monster.dae```

```javascript
var url = 'models/monster.dae'
loader.load(url, function(object3d){
    // this function will be notified when the model is loaded
    scene.add(object3d)
})
```

There is a special case for the OBJ/MTL models as they need 2 urls, one for
the 
[OBJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file), one for the 
[MTL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file#Material_template_library). In this case, just provides both
urls in a array like this.

```javascript
var urls = ['models/monster.obj', 'models/monster.mtl']
loader.load(urls, function(object3d){
    // this function will be notified when the model is loaded
    scene.add(object3d)
})
```
